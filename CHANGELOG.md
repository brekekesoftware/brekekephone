- Reconnect SIP if PN token is expired or timeout of 10s
- Try to cancel/not displaying the PN if caller canceled the call: add more logic and fix bugs

- Show message instead of hangup button when call on hold
- Improve in-app notify+ringtone to not conflict with PN: hide in-app notify if it has PN for that call, if no PN for that call, still show notify as usual
- Improve ios PN: try to get caller name directly instead of `Loading...` message
- Decode UC messages (they were encoded on server side)
- Some other bugs:
  - bug `_ua.isRegistered null`
  - bug android back button not working properly
  - bug with transfer hold/hangup
